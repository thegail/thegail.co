<h1>Hi!</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m Teddy. I&rsquo;m a programmer, mostly.</p>

<p>
	I make things sometimes. Occasionally those things are interesting enough to show to people, so I
	put them here. I&rsquo;m a chronic project abandoner so expect a lot of halfway thought-through ideas.
</p>

<p>
	Other things about me: I run sometimes (4:44 1600). I like making music
	(guitar mostly). <span class="nobreak">日本語を少し話せる。</span> If you couldn&rsquo;t already tell
	from this site&rsquo;s design, I&rsquo;m an extremely boring person, so I don&rsquo;t have much to
	say. Thanks for stopping by though.
</p>
