<h1>Hi!</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m Teddy. I&rsquo;m a programmer, mostly.</p>

<p>
	I make things sometimes. Occasionally those things are interesting enough to show to people, so I
	put them here. I&rsquo;m a chronic project abandoner so expect a lot of halfway thought-through
	ideas.
</p>

<p>
	Other things about me: I run sometimes (4:39 1600). I like making music (guitar mostly).
	<span class="nobreak">日本語を少し話せる。</span> I enjoy tinkering with electronics, and I think airplanes
	are pretty cool.
